# vyasa-work
Project for CS313E; Program uses binary search for series expansion.

#using the text file
Line 1 of work.txt contains the number of cases for the program to test. Work.txt line 1 is "2".
Lines beyond line 1 contain the "n" and "k" for the program.

#deeper explanation
The problem this program is designed to solve is as follows:
  Vyasa is a student working on a coding project. He has a drink that decreases his productivity (number of lines of code he can write) by factor "k" with every sip.
  What is v, the number of lines of code he must write before taking a sip of his drink? V should be the number of lines to write that allows Vyasa to complete his assignment and get the most sleep.
